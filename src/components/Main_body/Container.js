            <p>
              IEEE ANTS is a premier IEEE conference on advanced networking and
              telecommunications topics. IEEE ANTS is financially and
              technically supported by IEEE Communications Society. The
              distinguishing characteristic of IEEE ANTS is the promotion of an
              intense dialogue between academic and industry to bridge the gap
              between academic research, industry initiatives, and governmental
              policies. This is fostered through panel discussions, keynotes,
              invited talks, and industry exhibits, where academia is exposed to
              state-of-the-practice and results from trials and interoperability
              experiments. The industry, in turn, benefits from exposure to
              leading-edge research as well as an opportunity to communicate and
              collaborate with academic researchers regarding practical
              problems. This year the theme is “Ubiquitous Digital Connectivity
              and Economic Prosperity for All“. In addition to the myriad of
              topics mentioned in the list below, technical papers are invited
              which have special focus on enabling technologies for a ubiquitous
              digital connectivity.
